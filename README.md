In these troubling times, education has taken a backseat. Online platforms often fail to deliver "true" education effectively. Students often find themselves slacking off during classes.
In a world where we have become increasingly dependent on videos, it is important to organize the chaos efficiently.

Online classes do not provide the flexibility to learn from the best. Because to keep someone's attention, one needs to be a showman as well as a teacher.

This is where we come in, Edu Troop. We provide solutions aimed at students who want to make the best use of the Internet to learn, rather than just give attendance and call it a day.

Edu Troop is a community powered platform which incorporates the usage of existing videos to provide the best free and open source solutions to online education.

Our goal is a student centric one. We believe that students can achieve a whole lot more than what is being taught to them, and we are here to do just that.

How does it work?


-Students and faculties submit the best videos available online on a certain topic.
-Experts, professionals and AI sort through them to find the best of the best.
-The video is then hosted on the platform, which the members of the platform can vote.
-This ensures that the top notch content on any particular topic reaches students, for free.
